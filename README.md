# Data-Retrieval-through-Visual-Basic
This folder contains data retrieval process implemented with XPath Language version 3.1 (XML). The whole process can be pictured or generally divided into the following subprocesses:

1. Use OAuth 2.0 (which is frequently used by big companies such as Facebook, Google and Microsoft) to securely access database with a given API key.
2. Do subsequent API calls (defined with XPath and XML) to retrieve data from the database and parse data into spreadsheet.
3. Use the data to generate reports (business, contacts, membership renewal, membership lapsed etc.) 

The main purpose for this project is to provide a means to securely access the database and retrieve data for business analysis.
